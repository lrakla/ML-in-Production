# ML-in-Production
It is easy to prototype ML models. With higher levels of abstraction, the expertise required to build any ML model decreases daily. 
It is not easy to make an ML model available to millions of users, maintain it, and monitor it. In this repo, I want to 
consolidate resources to help people take their models to production, document what leading tech companies do, and how to get started with MLOps.
